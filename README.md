# Arduino-RC-Car-Project-Workshop

Constructed a remote-controlled car using an Arduino, DC motors, and a Bluetooth module. The car was controlled using an Arduino power remote controller that was also constructed using a Bluetooth module and a joystick module.

Experience gained through the creation of the project was then used to host a workshop to teach fellow students at Moreno Valley Community College how to build a remote-controlled RC car using Arduino.
